   This project takes a look at the fifa game stats of players over the past 5 years. I decided to take a closer look at the age,weight, and nationality distributions of the players. I began with cleaning the code ie. using strip, lowercasing the column names, changing abbreviations, identifying null values and replacing them with the mean, and changing data types that were incorrectly categorized.
