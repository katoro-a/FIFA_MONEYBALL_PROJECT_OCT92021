# About the data set 
   Covers FIFA game stats of players over a 5 year continuum, some stats include : ID, Name, Age, OVA, Nationality, Club, Position, etc ... With a total of 99 columns and 17125 rows. 
      
# Objective/Question  
   Take a closer look at the data, determine which columns to keep and clean before preforming a peliminary analysis.
   If time allows create a model to predict OVA.

# Used tools/methods
- strip 
- lowercase column names
- changing column names
- identifying null values 
   - replace numerical values with the median/mean
   - categorical with most occuring value of that column  
- correcting dtypes 
- scaling numerical data types/endcoding categorical types

   This project takes a look at the fifa game stats of players over the past 5 years. I decided to take a closer look at the age,weight, and nationality distributions of the players. I began with cleaning the code ie. using strip, lowercasing the column names, changing abbreviations, identifying null values and replacing them with the mean, and changing data types that were incorrectly categorized.
