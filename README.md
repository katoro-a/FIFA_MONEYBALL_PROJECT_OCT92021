# Objective/Question  
   Take a closer look at the data, determine which columns to keep and clean before preforming a peliminary analysis.
   If time allows create a model to predict OVA.

# Used tools/methods
- strip 
- lowercase column names
- changing column names
- identifying null values 
   - replace numerical values with the median/mean
   - categorical with most occuring value of that column  
- correcting dtypes 
- scaling numerical data types/endcoding categorical types

## Workflow 

# Next time 
   Identify areas of focus/interest to preform differnt predicitve models on. Use more than one mothod of encoding and differnt models to chose the model of best fit.
